# Important Instructions for Claude

## Development Guidelines

**DO NOT run the following commands:**
- `npm run dev` - Development server will be started manually by programmers
- `npm run build` - Build process will be executed manually by programmers

These commands are handled manually by the development team for testing purposes. Please avoid running them during any code assistance or modifications.

## Additional Notes
- Focus on code changes, bug fixes, and feature implementation
- Test your changes logically without running the development server
- Ensure code quality and best practices are followed
- Manual testing will be performed by programmers after changes
